## About the Project
This is a project I created to complete **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)** assignment.

The page is fully responsive on both 
Desktop & Mobile * but Keyboard Keys are not yet supported, to type a number, you can only use your cursor and click for now.

This is my own solution. I wrote every line of codes on my own.
